* __Yelp Sort By Date__ - redirects you to a "Newest First" listing of reviews on a Yelp page, rather than the default "Yelp Sort".

* __Remove Youtube Frontpage Videos__ - Removes all suggested and trending videos (many of the thumbnails are clickbait or just plain disturbing) on the frontpage of Youtube.
