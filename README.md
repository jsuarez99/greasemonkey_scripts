Greasemonkey scripts

* __Yelp Sort By Date__ - redirects you to a "Newest First" listing of reviews on a Yelp page, rather than the default "Yelp Sort".

* __Remove Youtube Frontpage Videos__ - Removes all suggested and trending videos (many of the thumbnails are clickbait or just plain disturbing) on the frontpage of Youtube.

* __Block Youtube Channels__ - Remove results from unwanted channels on the Youtube search results page.

* __Safe Reddit User Links__ - Removes all urls on a page going to a user's profile and replaces it with "#". When browsing reddit I like to collapse comments to get to the next one, but sometimes I'd accidentally click on the user's name and be taken to their profile instead. Some people have a very NSFW/NSFL post history which I don't want to come across any more. Not dynamic yet, so if more comments are loaded, they won't have their links scrubbed.
